Day by day, youngsters are more active digitally and more comfortable in using the online platforms. The intention is to digitalize the banks as well.
The physical bank requires more time in making the services available to the constumers. These tasks include depositing money, updating passbooks, opening Accounts.
Traditionally these tasks involve physical presence at the branch of the bank and meeting the managers, which consumes lot of time while standing in queue, travelling, waiting
for the turn of your application. Banks would be saving lot of resouces in builiding, running and maintaing the physical bank. This would include infrastructure cost, 
operational costs and other variable expenses. Banks can therefore provide higher rate of deposit interests and returns. Machine Learning could also provide some useful insights and 
valuable personalized experience to customers which were not available in traditional banking system.
