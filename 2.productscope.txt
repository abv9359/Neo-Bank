The scope of Neo Bank could be increased as much as possible as it aims to be a highly scalable project. Integration with other digital platforms like amazon pay, whatsapp,
and other platforms can make a common man to use the banking features effortlessly. Some out of scope areas are
- Lack of awareness among people in using electronic gadgets.
- Lack of trust which results into feara among people who prefer face to face transactions.
- Some additional features which physical bank offers but couldn't be provided by Neo-Bank such as cash deposit and Loan as it requires additional form-fillup and documents.
- Recognition from Central Bank(like RBI) is required to be more effective.
- Neo Banks don't have their licenses and are interdependent on partner collaborations.
